#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This function performs the gauss seidel iteration to compute the numerical
# solution at every step. Numerical solution is updated while the residuals
# are being calculated
# Arguments:
#   nx, ny = number of grid in x and y direction
#   dx, dy = grid spacing in x and y direction
#   source = source term on rhs of poisson equation ∇2ϕ = S
#   u_numerical = numerical solution for different problems
#   residual = residual at each grid location
#   rms, initial_rms = root mean squire of residual
#   maximum_iterations = maximum number of iterations
#
# Algorithm:
# 00    r^0 = S - ∇^2(ϕ^0)
# 10    d = ∇^2(r^k)
# 20    aa = <r,r>
# 30    bb = <d,r>
# 40    cc = aa/bb
# 50    ϕ^(k+1) = ϕ^k + cc*r^k
# 60    r^(k+1) = r^k - cc*r^k
# 30    calculate rms for r^(k+1) and go to 10 if rms < tolerance
