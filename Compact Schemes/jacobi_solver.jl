#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This function performs the jacobi iteration to compute the numerical
# solution at every step. Numerical solution is updated after residual is
# calculated over the whole domain
#
# Arguments:
#   nx, ny = number of grid in x and y direction
#   dx, dy = grid spacing in x and y direction
#   source = source term on rhs of poisson equation ∇2ϕ = S
#   u_numerical = numerical solution for different problems
#   residual = residual at each grid location
#   rms, initial_rms = root mean squire of residual
#   maximum_iterations = maximum number of iterations
#
# Algorithm:
# 10    r^(k+1) = S - ∇^2(ϕ^k)
# 20    ϕ^(k+1) = ϕ^k + ωr^(k+1)
# 30    calculate residual rms for ϕ^(k+1) and go to 10 if rms < tolerance
